Hello, I'm Yeonjun In.
I'm a Ph.D. student in the Industrial and Systems Department at KAIST,
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/).
I'm actively on research with my best colleagues at [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/).

During my doctoral studies, I served as a research scientist intern at Adobe Research.

My research topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Mitigating Data-centric Issues in AI Systems
  - Data noise / Adversarial Attacks / Anomalies
  - Distribution/Domain Shift
  - Continual Learning
  - Long-tailed Distribution / Weak-supervision
- Graph Representation Learning
